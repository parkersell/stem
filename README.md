# Overview
Personal Project: A Django website that syncs to a fitbit and compiles data from multiple students and displays every student on a single chart or table. 

# Background
Inspired by the Pennslyvania Governor's STEM Competition 2020. High school students were presented with the prompt "improve the lives of Pennsylvanians through STEM." 
My school's team, Central Dauphin High School, came up with the idea to find a way to improve the lives of children with special needs through the use of Fitbit devices. We reached out to Fitbit and other companies to find an improved solution. 

# Our Goal
We wanted to provide to teachers a dashboard that allows them to monitor their student's heartrates and use statistical tools to deliver meaningful real time data. We wanted to provide an inexpensive solution through self-created personalized software. 

# My Extension of the Competition
After the competition ended due to Coronavirus, I decided to teach myself web development. A website was the best solution to this problem, and it seemed like an interesting application in the python language. Through this project, I learned about the Django framework and basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Current State of the Project
This website currently runs well on a local server. However, I created the project on a Windows Computer and the deployment to a cheap linux webserver didn't go well. I tested by syncing with my personal fitbit, but the framework is there to include multiple students. I utilized Chart.js and Django-REST-Framework in creating the charts.  

# Future Improvements
I'm currently looking to use self-taught Data Science tools to run realtime analysis on the fitbit users and display them in tables on the website.
